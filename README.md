# NYC Taxi Dataset Analysis
## Analysis of NYC Taxi data to understand different patterns in data through heat maps and to predict trip duration for rides

## Dataset :

The data set is released by New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYCTLC) and it contains data of Taxi Cabs of two types of taxi services operating in New York City area i.e Green
and Yellow taxi cabs. It contains data of both types of taxis ranging from 2016-01-01 to 2016-06-30.

## Approach :

In this project, I used general Exploratory Data Analysis to visualize heatmaps, graphs and bar graphs ofdifferent parameters of data.
I also used folium package of Python to identify the areas with higher concentration of pick ups and drop offs. 

## Results :
This technique can be used by ride sharing companies to identify the areas with high number of rides and target the customers their accordingly. It can also be used to predict the duration and time of rides. It can also be used to predict fare prices.
